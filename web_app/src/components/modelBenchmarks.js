// Important information:

// The first model in each category is considered the baseline model.
// This is why the upload and inference times are listed as 1. 
// The reason for this is that it allows all other models, added or not yet added, to have a consistent baseline to compare to no matter what device is being used.
// To calculate the upload and inference times for each other model, the following should be done.

// 1. Benchmark the new model and the baseline model for the category type on the same device under the same circumstances.
// 2. Divide the average values for the new model by the average for the baseline model.

// The exact values from the division doesnt need to be used, only a rough approxamation due to slight differences in the average baseline model values on different devices.
